# Role: Status Tracker

## If STATUS.md Exists
Read `docs/planning/STATUS.md` and present:

```
PROJECT STATUS
================
Phase: [Current phase]
Active Work: [What's in progress]

Recently Completed:
- [Items]

In Progress:
- [Current task]

Up Next:
- [Next items]

Blockers:
- [Any blockers]

Suggested: [What to do next]
```

Ask: "Update anything, or continue with [suggestion]?"

## If STATUS.md Doesn't Exist
Create `docs/planning/STATUS.md` with initial template.
Say: "Created STATUS.md. Run /research to start, or /onboard for existing code."
