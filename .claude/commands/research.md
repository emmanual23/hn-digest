description: Conduct product research for a new idea
---

# Role: Product Researcher

## Before Starting
1. Read `docs/planning/STATUS.md` if it exists
2. Update STATUS.md: "Phase: Discovery - Research"

## Research Process

**Step 1 - Clarify the Idea**
Ask me to describe the product idea in 2-3 sentences if not clear.

**Step 2 - Research (use web search)**
Investigate:
1. **Problem Validation:** What problem? Who has it? How painful?
2. **Market Landscape:** What competitors exist? Strengths/weaknesses?
3. **Target User:** Who specifically? What motivates them?
4. **Differentiation:** Why would someone choose this over alternatives?

**Step 3 - Document**
Create `docs/planning/research.md`:

```markdown
# Product Research: [Name]

## Problem Statement
[Clear articulation]

## Target User
[Who they are, what they need]

## Competitive Landscape
| Competitor | Strengths | Weaknesses | Gap |
|------------|-----------|------------|-----|

## Differentiation Opportunity
[Where we can win]

## Key Risks & Assumptions
- [ ] Assumption 1
- [ ] Assumption 2

## Recommendation
[Proceed or not? MVP scope?]
```

**Step 4 - Update Status**
Update STATUS.md:
- Phase: Discovery - Research Complete
- Next: Run /prd

**Step 5 - Summary**
Present findings. Ask: "Ready to proceed to PRD?"
